Credit Risk Analysis report
1. Purpose: This analysis aims to evaluate the performance of the credit risk model. The task involves predicting whether a loan will be high risk or low risk, and the model will be assessed on its accuracy, precision, and recall scores. The purpose of this analysis is to identify whether or not the model will be suitable for use by the company to make informed decisions based on the predicted results.
2. Results:
•	Accuracy Score: 99%, meaning 99% of all items correctly predicted
•	Precision Score(Low Risk): 1.00, 100% of true items were correctly predicited by the model for low risk loans
•	Precision Score(High Risk): 0.85, 85% of true items were correctly predicted by the model for high risk loans
•	Recall Score(Low Risk): 0.99, 99% of false items were correctly predicted by the model for low risk loans
•	Recall Score(High Risk): 0.91, 91% of false items were correctly predicted by the model for high risk loans
3. Summary: The single machine learning model demonstrated exceptional performance on predicting loans. It achieved an accuracy score of 99%, indicating that the model correctly predicted in most instances. The model is better at predicting true values for low risk loans. High risk loans were predicted slightly less accurately, however predicting correctly 85-91% of the time is still extremely accurate.
Considering the high accuracy, precision, and recall scores, this model is recommended for use by the company, especially if correctly identifying positive cases is important. This model will be very useful for assisting the company in choosing whether or not to allow a customer to take a loan.
